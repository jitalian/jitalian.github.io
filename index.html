            Hi, I'm Justin, a software engineer. I am a recent graduate from MCIT 
            program at UPenn and I am current looking for entry-level positions. 
            From a young age I have had a keen
            interest in computers and understanding how hardware and software
            work. During my time at UPenn I developed strong programming skills, 
            and a strong passion for developing clean, efficient, and reliable 
            code through my work on projects in Python, Java, C and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before pursuing the MCIT degree at UPenn, I worked for several years
            as a transportation engineer at the Delaware Valley Regional
            Planning Commission where I was involved in transportation and air
            quality analysis for the region. This experience sparked my interest in MCIT and
            in learning more about the computer hardware and software that
            powered the model.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about continuing to learn and develop my programming
            and problem-solving skills as I embark on my new career in software
            engineering. Thank you for visiting my website and have a wonderful day!
          </p>
