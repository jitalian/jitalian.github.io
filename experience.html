          <ul>
            <li>
              Applied a complex regional travel demand model to obtain forecasts
              for future traffic volumes and transit ridership in the Delaware
              Valley region.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed a new post-processing Python script that read model run
              results and tabulated them into Excel files for later use in other
              analyses.
            </li>
            <li>Diagnosed and fixed model crashes and other computer bugs.</li>
            <li>
              Utilized MOVES, an emission modeling system, in conjunction with
              the regional travel demand model to determine the effect of
              transportation projects on regional air quality.

              Analyzed comprehensive operational data including mileage, GPS,

            <li>
              Developed a model to predict delay experienced by passengers using

            <li>
              Studied data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
              and used a clustering analysis to predict how a passenger's choice
              of transportation was affected by an experimental pilot program.
