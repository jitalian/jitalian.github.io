            <li>
              Applied a complex regional travel demand model to obtain forecasts
              for future traffic volumes and transit ridership in the Delaware
              Valley region.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed a new post-processing Python script that read model run
              results and tabulated them into Excel files for later use in other
              analyses.
            </li>
            <li>Diagnosed and fixed model crashes and other computer bugs.</li>
            <li>
              Utilized MOVES, an emission modeling system, in conjunction with
              the regional travel demand model to determine the effect of
              transportation projects on regional air quality.
